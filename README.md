# Introduction to Deep Learning

This repository holds my solutions for the [Introduction to Deep Learning](https://dvl.in.tum.de/teaching/i2dl-ss19/) course of the summer semester 2019 held by [Prof. Dr. Laura Leal-Taixé](https://dvl.in.tum.de/team/lealtaixe/) and [Prof. Dr. Matthias Nießner](http://www.niessnerlab.org/members/matthias_niessner/profile.html).

The course was offered by the [Dynamic Vision and Learning Group](https://dvl.in.tum.de/) at [Technische Universität München (TUM)](https://www.tum.de/).

## Exercise 1

### Softmax

- Implementation of a fully-vectorized loss function for the Softmax classifier
- Implementation of the fully-vectorized expression for its analytic gradient
- Check of the implementation with numerical gradient
- Usage of a validation set to tune the learning rate and regularization strength
- Optimization of the loss function with SGD
- Visualization of the final learned weights

### Two layer net

- Implementation of a fully-connected two layer neural network to perform classification on the CIFAR-10 dataset
- Implementation of the forward and backward pass
- Training of the NN and hyperparameter training
